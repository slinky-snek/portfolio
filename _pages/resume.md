PROJECTS
Balloon Boppers - Personal project

Balloon Boppers is a 2 to 4 person arena shooter in which the players are continuously falling. The players can only move around the arena using a grappling hook. I was the only programmer on a team of two.
I was responsible for designing and implementing the shooting, grappling, and pickup mechanics. The shooting and pickup mechanics were implemented using Unrealâ€™s Gameplay Ability System. I designed and implemented aim assist systems including bullet magnetism, target gravity, and area cursor to better the game feel on controllers. I was also responsible for implementing all game UI which encompassed menus and the player HUD.

Delta V Innovations Database - Senior project with crash reconstruction industry client Delta V Innovations Inc.

Led a twelve week project where our four person team was paired with an industry client to develop a MySQL database and accompanying file upload application. I led all team and client meetings, working to ensure strong communication within our team and with our client. I set and managed our milestones, developed the user interface for our application using Java and Swing, and designed an algorithm to quickly remove duplicates from our large data sources.
