Here's some snippets from work I was doing earlier this year on a prototype for a UFO game. The idea is that all animation for the UFO is driven by a physics constraint.
I wanted to create a floppy flying saucer without the need for any blend spaces or animation assets. I also thought the physics constraint would give a more fluid animation. 
I wanted follow-through and other randomness that could be more difficult to capture with traditional animation assets. The game was originally imagined as an online multiplayer game, but
I think a split-screen party game might be a better fit in the near future.
