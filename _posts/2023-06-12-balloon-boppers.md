Balloon Boppers is a 2 to 4 person arena shooter in which the players are continuously falling. The players can only move around the arena using a grappling hook.
To win, the player must have the most kills by the end of the timed match. The pickup in the game lets a player "stun" another player which renders their 
grapple useless for 3 seconds. 

I was the only programmer on a team of two, which included one artist and myself. 

Responsibilities:

  * Designed and implemented shooting, grappling, and pickup mechanics. The shooting mechanic and pickup were both implemented using Unreal's Gameplay Ability System.
  * Implemented all game UI including menus and player HUD.
  * Designed and implemented aim assist systems including bullet magnetism, area cursor, and target gravity to better the game feel on controllers.
