Balloon Boppers is a 2 to 4 person local multiplayer arena shooter in which the players are continuously falling. The players can only move around the arena using a grappling hook.
To win, the player must have the most kills by the end of the timed match. Along with fighting others, players must stay in the arena to stay alive.
The game also includes a pickup which gives the player a stun ability. This renders their target's grapple useless for 3 seconds.

This was a personal project developed in Unreal Engine 5. I was the only programmer and collaborated with one artist.

Highlights:

  * Designed and implemented shooting, grappling, and pickup mechanics. The shooting mechanic and pickup were both implemented using Unreal's Gameplay Ability System.
  * Designed and implemented aim assist systems including bullet magnetism, area cursor, and target gravity to better the game feel on controllers.
  * Implemented all game UI including menus and player HUD.
  * Designed and implemented all game mode logic.
